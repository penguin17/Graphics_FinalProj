Main Goals of Live Environment
- Have human models walking around in simple patterns
- Have car models drive in the streets in simple patterns
- Add more to the environment to make it feel lively as possible; example, adding trees, making the floor represent a road 
- Enclose the environment in a big cube so the user doesn't see empty white space when looking far away
- Adjust the building sizes so it makes the city buildings look a lot bigger than the character models
- Position buildings to match the floor which would represent the roads

Side Goals (If finish early)
-  Add anything else that you think can liven the environment more. Example like adding birds that fly around in specific
path

Notes of things that I'm planning to implement that'll help you with your part that I'd be using with animations

- I'm planning on cleaning up my code to make it easier to animate and I believe it'd be beneficial for you to use it too
since you might want to do some exerpiments on how somethings would like when animated a certain way. The plan is to make 
a class called character model that allows you to dynamically add parts to the model. So for example, if you want to 
animate an arm on a simple character model, it'll allow you to call a function to add the arm to the model with a specific
key to reference to that arm later if you'd like to rotate it.

- Until it's implemented, I was thinking that you can make a simple character models of your own, or simply download them 
from the internet and have them moving in the path and then we can work together on the animations

Notes of things that I'm not so sure of how to implement and need further thinking
- How the road should be made? (Maybe something through paint since just going to be 2D)
